# Owner Notification System Status

## ‚úÖ System Verification Complete

### Current Status: **OPERATIONAL**

The owner notification system has been verified and is fully functional with the following components:

## üìä System Components

### Backend Services ‚úÖ
- **CommunicationService**: Sends owner email notifications for:
  - New tattoo requests
  - New appointments
  - Payment received
  - Appointment cancellations
- **RealtimeService**: Pushes real-time events to dashboard via SSE
- **EmailTemplateService**: Manages email templates with dynamic variables
- **AuditService**: Logs all notification activities

### Frontend Components ‚úÖ
- **NotificationCenter**: Real-time notification bell in dashboard header
- **Dashboard Notifications Page**: Shows Square settings and notification stats
- **SSE Connection**: Auto-reconnects and displays live updates

### Email Templates ‚úÖ
All owner notification templates are installed:
- `owner_new_request` - New tattoo request notifications
- `owner_new_appointment` - New appointment bookings
- `owner_payment_received` - Payment confirmations
- `owner_appointment_cancelled` - Cancellation alerts

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required
OWNER_EMAIL=bowenislandtattooshop@gmail.com  # ‚úÖ Configured

# Optional (defaults to enabled)
OWNER_NOTIFICATION_ENABLED=true  # ‚úÖ Enabled

# Email Service (one required for production)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxx  # ‚úÖ Configured
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@bowenislandtattoo.com  # ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs configuration
```

## üìà Notification Flow

1. **Event Occurs** (e.g., new tattoo request submitted)
2. **CommunicationService** sends email to owner (if OWNER_EMAIL configured)
3. **Real-time event** created for dashboard notification
4. **Dashboard** receives event via SSE and shows notification
5. **Audit log** records notification status

## üß™ Testing Tools

Three verification scripts are available:

### 1. Full System Verification
```bash
npx tsx scripts/verify-owner-notifications.ts
```
Tests email configuration, templates, and sends test notifications.

### 2. Real-time Notification Test
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-realtime-notifications.ts
```
Sends sample notifications to test dashboard real-time updates.

### 3. Email Template Seeding
```bash
npx tsx scripts/seed-owner-request-template.ts
```
Creates missing email templates if needed.

## üì± Dashboard Integration

The notification system integrates with the dashboard at:
- `/dashboard` - Notification bell icon in header
- `/dashboard/notifications` - Full notification center

### Features:
- Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events
- Unread count badge
- Priority-based coloring (urgent, high, medium, low)
- Browser notifications (with permission)
- Connection status indicator

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

1. **EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS not configured**
   - Emails will use default sender address
   - Should be set to a verified domain email

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Configure EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS** in production environment
2. **Test in production** with real appointments and requests
3. **Monitor audit logs** for any failed notifications
4. **Verify browser notifications** are enabled for urgent alerts

## üìä Metrics

The system tracks:
- Total notifications sent
- Confirmations sent on booking
- Reminders sent (Square handles automatically)
- Daily notification volume
- Failed notification attempts (in audit logs)

## üîê Security

- Owner email is only sent to configured OWNER_EMAIL address
- All notifications are logged in audit trail
- Email templates use sanitized variables
- SSE connection requires authentication

## üìû Support

If notifications are not working:
1. Check OWNER_EMAIL is configured correctly
2. Verify email service API keys are valid
3. Check audit logs for error details
4. Ensure dashboard SSE connection is established
5. Review browser console for connection errors
