Let's keep it looking fresh:

**Tonight:**
‚Ä¢ Keep that bandage on for 2-4 more hours
‚Ä¢ Then gently wash with unscented soap (be nice to it!)
‚Ä¢ Pat dry - don't rub! 
‚Ä¢ Thin layer of aftercare ointment

**Next 2 weeks - this is where the magic happens:**
‚Ä¢ Wash it 2-3 times daily (morning, night, and maybe midday)
‚Ä¢ Keep it moisturized but not drowning in lotion
‚Ä¢ No swimming or hot tubs (I know, tough on Bowen Island!)
‚Ä¢ Don't pick at it - let it do its thing naturally
‚Ä¢ Avoid direct sun - your tattoo is basically a vampire right now

**Pro tips from the team:**
